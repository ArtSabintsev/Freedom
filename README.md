## Installation Instructions

```

### Carthage

### Swift Package Manager
```swift
.Package(url: "https://github.com/ArtSabintsev/Freedom.git", majorVersion: 1)
```

## Usage

Open your `Info.plist` file, and add the following URL schemes to the `LSApplicationQueriesSchemes` key:

```xml
<key>LSApplicationQueriesSchemes</key>
<array>
  <string>googlechrome</string>
  <string>firefox</string>
  <string>brave</string>
</array>
```

Add the following code to some actionable/tappable element in your project. In this example, I am using an IBAction from a UIButton.

```swift
@IBAction func openURL(_ sender: UIButton) {

       // A Sample URL that just happens to be my personal website.
       let url = URL(string: "http://www.sabintsev.com")!

       // Enable Debug Logs (disabled by default)
       Freedom.debugEnabled = true

       // Fetch activities for all third-party browsers supported by Freedom.
       let activities = Freedom.browsers()

       // Alternatively, one could select a specific browser (or browsers)
       // let activities = Freedom.browsers([.chrome])

       let vc = UIActivityViewController(activityItems: [url], applicationActivities: activities)

       present(vc, animated: true, completion: nil)
   }

```

## Notes
 Even if you enable Freedom to support all browsers via `Freedom.browsers()`, only the browsers installed on your users device will be visible to the them in the share sheet (i.e., `UIActivityViewController`). Therefore, it is beneficial to all of your users to initialize Freedom with all supported browsers.
